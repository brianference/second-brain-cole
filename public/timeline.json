      "content": "**User Story:**\nAs a mobile user managing tasks, I want to tap on a card to see its full description and details so that I can review task information on my phone.\n\n**Current Problem:**\nWhen tapping a card on mobile devices (Android/iPhone), NOTHING happens. No modal, no details popup, completely unresponsive.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nTap card → Modal opens with full description, tags, priority, status\n\n**Root Cause:**\nLikely desktop-only click handlers, or mobile tap events not attached to cards.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\nGiven I am on a mobile device (Android or iPhone)\nWhen I tap on any task card\nThen a modal should open showing full task details\nAnd I should see: title, description, tags, priority, status, edit/delete buttons\n\nGiven the modal is open\nWhen I tap outside the modal or tap close button\nThen the modal should close\n\nGiven I tap \"Edit\" in the modal\nWhen I make changes\nThen changes should save and modal should close\n\n**Technical Notes:**\n- Check if click event listeners work on touch devices\n- May need: addEventListener('touchend') in addition to 'click'\n- Test on Playwright mobile projects (Pixel 7, iPhone 14 Pro)\n- Verify modal z-index is high enough on mobile\n\n**Test Cases:**\n1. Tap card on Android → Modal opens\n2. Tap card on iPhone → Modal opens\n3. Tap outside modal → Modal closes\n4. Edit card from mobile modal → Saves correctly\n\n**Priority:** CRITICAL - Brian mentioned this twice (first as general mobile issue, now specific to cards)",

No further work needed.\n\n**Brian's Request:** \"Give the designer a task using new claude code design skills to further improve the header and navigation and colors of the itinerary app\"\n\n**Current State:**\n- Red header with white text\n- Horizontal day tabs\n- Map/Satellite toggle\n- Timeline menu\n- Basic color scheme\n\n**Designer Task:**\n\nUsing Claude Code design skills, create comprehensive design improvements for:\n\n**1. Header Design**\n- Modern gradient or glassmorphism effect\n- Better typography hierarchy\n- Responsive sizing\n- Light/dark mode support\n- Subtle animations\n\n**2. Navigation UX**\n- Day tabs: Better visual feedback for active day\n- Smooth transitions between days\n- Touch-friendly targets (≥44px)\n- Swipe gestures for mobile\n- Timeline view improvements\n\n**3. Color System**\n- 2-3 color palette (per COMMANDMENTS.md #5)\n- Consistent across light/dark modes\n- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)\n- Semantic colors: primary, secondary, accent\n- Restaurant category colors already defined:\n  - Breakfast: Orange (#FF6B35)\n  - Lunch: Teal (#4ECDC4)\n  - Dinner: Purple (#9B59B6)\n\n**4. Mobile-First Responsive**\n- Mobile optimizations\n- Desktop enhancements\n- Tablet breakpoints\n- Touch interactions\n\n**Designer Agent Workflow:**\n\n1. **Read current implementation:**\n   - /workspace/projects/tokyo-osaka-trip-2026/netlify-deploy/app.html\n\n2. **Generate design specs:**\n   - Header mockups (3 variants)\n   - Navigation patterns\n   - Color palette with hex codes\n   - Typography scale\n   - Spacing system\n   - Animation timing\n\n3. **Create 20+ test cases:**\n   - Header responsive behavior\n   - Day tab interactions\n   - Color contrast checks\n   - Dark mode rendering\n   - Mobile touch targets\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - DESIGN-SPECS.md (comprehensive design system)\n   - MOCKUPS/ directory (visual examples)\n   - TEST-CASES.md (20+ UI/UX tests)\n\n**Handoff to Coder:**\nAfter Designer approval, Coder implements following exact specs.\n\n**Screenshot proof required:**\nMEDIA:./screenshots/trip-map-header-before.png\nMEDIA:./screenshots/trip-map-header-after-desktop.png\nMEDIA:./screenshots/trip-map-header-after-mobile.png\n\n**Priority:** P2 (Medium) - UX polish, not critical bugs\n\n**Launch Designer Agent:**\n```bash\ncd /workspace/agents/designer-agent\n./launch-designer.sh \"Review trip map header, navigation, and color system\"\n```",

**Analytics** → show usage stats, memory growth, search patterns\n   - **Profile** → user settings, preferences, API key status\n   - **New** → create new memory, collection, tag\n   - All buttons must have href or proper routing\n\n6. **Sources - Make Clickable**\n   - **mem0** → show mem0 database entries, click to view details\n   - **Supermemory** → show Supermemory cloud entries, click to view\n   - Show entry count for each source\n   - Filter memories by source\n   - Sync status indicator (last synced timestamp)\n\n7. **Files and Tasks - Make Clickable**\n   - **Files** → show workspace .md files, click to view content\n   - **Tasks** → show kanban tasks, click to view/edit\n   - Integration with python-kanban API\n   - File browser with search/filter\n   - Task list with status indicators\n\n8. **Smart Views - Make Functional**\n   - Define smart views (by tag, by project, by date, etc.)\n   - Auto-filter based on criteria\n   - Show view count badge\n   - Save custom views\n   - Examples:\n     • Today's Notes\n     • TPUSA Research\n     • Code Snippets\n     • Meeting Notes\n     • Ideas\n\n9. **New Collection - Make Functional**\n   - \"New Collection\" button creates collection\n   - Collection = grouped memories (like a folder)\n   - Name collection, add description\n   - Drag-drop memories into collection\n   - Delete/rename collections\n   - Show collection count in sidebar\n\n10. **Testing Checklist**\n    - ✅ All left sidebar views navigate correctly\n    - ✅ Search returns accurate results\n    - ✅ Quick actions execute\n    - ✅ Top buttons (Analytics, Profile, New) work\n    - ✅ mem0 source clickable, shows entries\n    - ✅ Supermemory source clickable, shows entries\n    - ✅ Files clickable, displays content\n    - ✅ Tasks clickable, shows task details\n    -

      "content": "**Problem:** On mobile, the kanban cards are overly sensitive: the card modal pops up while the user is scrolling down the list.\n\n**User Impact:**\n- Scrolling becomes frustrating / unusable\n- Accidental modal opens cause context loss\n- Feels \"jittery\" and broken on touch devices\n\n**Root Cause (likely):**\n- Click/tap handler fires even when the gesture is a scroll\n- No movement threshold / gesture discrimination\n- Potential use of `touchend`/`click` without checking `touchmove`\n\n**Fix Requirements:**\n1. **Tap vs Scroll Discrimination**\n   - Track `touchstart` position/time\n   - If finger moves > **10–15px** (configurable), treat as scroll → **do not open modal**\n   - Only open modal if:\n     - movement <= threshold AND\n     - duration <= 500ms (optional) AND\n     - no active scroll inertia\n\n2. **Pointer Events Support (preferred)**\n   - Use `pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup` when available\n   - Fallback to touch/mouse events\n   - Ensure handlers are `passive: true` where appropriate (move), but modal open on `pointerup`\n\n3. **Stop Ghost Clicks**\n   - After scroll gesture detected, suppress subsequent `click` (e.g., set a short-lived flag for 300ms)\n\n4. **UX Polish**\n   - Keep card tap responsive when user intends to open modal\n   - No regressions on desktop (mouse click should still open modal)\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- On iPhone/Android, scrolling through cards does **not** open modals\n- Intentional taps reliably open modal\n- Works in Safari iOS + Chrome Android\n- No console errors\n\n**Test Cases:**\n- Slow scroll through list (no modals)\n- Fast flick scroll (no modals)\n- Tap card while stationary (modal opens)\n- Tap small movement (<10px) (modal opens)\n- Long press then scroll (no modal)\n- Desktop click (modal opens)\n\n**Priority:** HIGH (mobile usability)\n**Estimate:** 1–2 hours\n",
